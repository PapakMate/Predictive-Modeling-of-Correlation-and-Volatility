# Predictive Modeling of Correlation and Volatility in Multivariate Financial Time Series

## Overview

This repository currently hosts the pre-publication version of our scientific paper:

**"Predictive Modeling of Correlation and Volatility in Multivariate Financial Time Series"**

The paper has been **accepted for publication in IEEE Xplore** and was presented at the **MIPRO 2025 convention**.

**Important Note:** This repository is intended for temporary access to the pre-print. It will be **deleted** once the paper is officially published and indexed on IEEE Xplore, at which point the final version will be accessible via the official IEEE platform.

## Abstract

This paper focuses on risk prediction in multivariate
financial return time series by decomposing the asset covariance
into its correlation and volatility components. Using a machine
learning approach, we develop predictive models which ensure
positive definiteness of the resulting matrices. The proposed
approach allows us to separately study the contributions of
correlation and volatility prediction to overall risk forecasting
performance. To evaluate the proposed approach, we compare
multiple performance metrics and assess the economic significance of our findings through a portfolio optimization application.
The results provide insights into the relative predictability of
correlation and volatility and their roles in portfolio optimization
and risk management.
